# Marshal-Catch Game

Marshal-Catch is a simple game built with Python's `turtle` module. The player controls a circle (Pac-Man) that moves around the screen to collect food while avoiding the screen boundaries.

## Features

- Move Pac-Man using arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`)
- Collect food to earn points
- Automatically resets when hitting the boundary
- Score tracking

## Requirements

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. No additional libraries are required as `turtle` and `random` come pre-installed with Python.

## Controls

- **Arrow keys**: Move Pac-Man in different directions

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to navigate Pac-Man.
- Eat the yellow food to increase your score.
- Avoid touching the screen boundaries; hitting them resets the game.
